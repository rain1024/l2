        "text": "Laissez-moi vous raconter l’histoire d'un Poulet. Ses amis l’appellent Petit Poulet. Petit Poulet vit dans une petite maison de poulet normale, dans une petite ville normale.\nIl n’est ni grand, ni petit. Il n’est ni gros, ni maigre. Il n’est ni intelligent ni stupide. Petit Poulet est un poulet tout à fait normal.\nPar une matinée tout à fait normale, Petit Poulet mange son petit-déjeuner dans la cuisine. Il aime les toasts avec du beurre et le café à la crème.\nIl lit les nouvelles. Il voit une histoire terrifiante avec un titre terrifiant, qui dit : LE CIEL EST EN TRAIN DE TOMBER !\nIl a si peur qu’il laisse tomber son toast dans son café. Plouf !« Le ciel est en train de tomber ! LE CIEL EST EN TRAIN DE TOMBER ! Je dois prévenir tout le monde ! » crie Petit Poulet.\nD’abord il envoie l’histoire par courriel à ses mille amis les plus proches. Puis il court dans la rue pour prévenir tous les autres.\n\nLa première personne qu’il rencontre dans la rue est Pauline la poule. Elle revient du supermarché.\n« Bonjour, Petit Poulet ! » dit Pauline. « Où vas-tu ? Pourquoi as-tu si peur ? »\n« Le ciel est en train de tomber ! Le ciel est en train de tomber ! » dit Petit Poulet.\n« Vraiment ? Comment le sais-tu ? » demande Pauline.\n« Je l’ai vu sur Internet ! » dit Petit Poulet.\n« Bon sang ! Ça doit être vrai ! » dit Pauline. « Allons-y ! »Petit Poulet et Pauline la poule courent alors ensemble sur la route vers le marais.\n\nEn arrivant au marais, ils rencontrent Carine la cane. Elle est en train de se baigner.‍\n« Salut, vous deux ! » dit Carine. « Où allez-vous ? Pourquoi avez-vous si peur ? »\n« Le ciel est en train de tomber ! Le ciel est en train de tomber ! »‍ disent Petit Poulet et Pauline ensemble.\n« Vraiment ? Comment le savez-vous ? » demande Carine.\n« Je l’ai vu sur Internet ! » dit Petit Poulet.\n« Oh non ! Ça doit être vrai ! » dit Carine. « Allons-y ! »\nAlors Petit Poulet, Pauline la poule et Carine la cane courent ensemble sur la route vers la ferme.\nEn arrivant à la ferme, ils rencontrent Louise l’oie. Elle lit des poèmes pour Roger le pigeon.\n« Salut tout le monde ! » dit Louise. « Où allez-vous ? Pourquoi avez-vous si peur ? »\n« Le ciel est en train de tomber ! LE CIEL EST EN TRAIN DE TOMBER ! » crient-ils tous ensemble.\n« Vraiment ? Comment le savez-vous ? » demande Roger.\n« NOUS L’AVONS VU SUR INTERNET » disent-ils tous.\n\n« Bonté divine ! Ça doit être vrai ! » dit Louise. « On n’a pas le temps pour la poésie. Allons-y ! »\nEt Petit Poulet, Pauline la poule, Carine la cane, Louise l’oie et Roger le pigeon courent ensemble sur la route vers la ville.\nSur la rue principale, ils rencontrent Gérard le renard. Gérard est assis dans un café, en train d’écrire sur son laptop.‍\n« Bonjour mes amis ! » dit Gérard. « Où allez-vous ? Pourquoi avez-vous si peur ? »\n« LE CIEL EST EN TRAIN DE TOMBER ! LE CIEEEEEEL EST EN TRAIN DE TOOOOOOMBER ! » crient-ils tous ensemble.\n« Vraiment ? Comment le savez-vous ? » demande Gérard.\n« NOUS L’AVONS VU SUR INTERNET ! » crient-ils tous.\n« Ouah ! Alors ça doit être vrai ! » dit le renard. « Mais ne vous inquiétez pas, les amis, je connais la cachette parfaite. Suivez-moi ! »\nGérard mène tout le monde à travers le village, le long de la route, à travers le champ et en haut d’une colline. Au sommet de la colline il y a une grande grotte sombre.\n« Entrez ! Entrez ! » dit Gérard. « Il y a assez de place pour tout le monde ! Le ciel ne nous tombera pas dessus ici. Nous sommes en sécurité. »\n\nLe lendemain matin, Petit Poulet et ses amis ont disparu. La grotte est vide.\nOù sont-ils allés ? Nous ne le savons pas vraiment. Mais je vais vous dire une chose : Gérard le Renard est très heureux. Il a le ventre bien gros et bien rond.\nIl s’assoit sous un arbre, sort son ordinateur portable et recommence à écrire."

        "text": "There were once five-and-twenty tin soldiers. They were all brothers, born of the same old tin spoon. They shouldered their muskets and looked straight ahead of them, splendid in their uniforms, all red and blue.\n\nThe very first thing in the world that they heard was, \"Tin soldiers!\" A small boy shouted it and clapped his hands as the lid was lifted off their box on his birthday. He immediately set them up on the table.\n\nAll the soldiers looked exactly alike except one. He looked a little different as he had been cast last of all. The tin was short, so he had only one leg. But there he stood, as steady on one leg as any of the other soldiers on their two. But just you see, he'll be the remarkable one.\n\nOn the table with the soldiers were many other playthings, and one that no eye could miss was a marvelous castle of cardboard. It had little windows through which you could look right inside it. And in front of the castle were miniature trees around a little mirror supposed to represent a lake. The wax swans that swam on its surface were reflected in the mirror. All this was very pretty but prettiest of all was the little lady who stood in the open doorway of the castle. Though she was a paper doll, she wore a dress of the fluffiest gauze. A tiny blue ribbon went over her shoulder for a scarf, and in the middle of it shone a spangle that was as big as her face. The little lady held out both her arms, as a ballet dancer does, and one leg was lifted so high behind her that the tin soldier couldn't see it at all, and he supposed she must have only one leg, as he did.\n\n\"That would be a wife for me,\" he thought. \"But maybe she's too grand. She lives in a castle. I have only a box, with four-and-twenty roommates to share it. That's no place for her. But I must try to make her acquaintance.\" Still as stiff as when he stood at attention, he lay down on the table behind a snuffbox, where he could admire the dainty little dancer who kept standing on one leg without ever losing her balance.\n\nWhen the evening came the other tin soldiers were put away in their box, and the people of the house went to bed. Now the toys began to play among themselves at visits, and battles, and at giving balls. The tin soldiers rattled about in their box, for they wanted to play too, but they could not get the lid open. The nutcracker turned somersaults, and the slate pencil squeaked out jokes on the slate. The toys made such a noise that they woke up the canary bird, who made them a speech, all in verse. The only two who stayed still were the tin soldier and the little dancer. Without ever swerving from the tip of one toe, she held out her arms to him, and the tin soldier was just as steadfast on his one leg. Not once did he take his eyes off her.\n\nThen the clock struck twelve and - clack! - up popped the lid of the snuffbox. But there was no snuff in it, no-out bounced a little black bogey, a jack-in-the-box.\n\n\"Tin soldier,\" he said. \"Will you please keep your eyes to yourself?\" The tin soldier pretended not to hear.\n\nThe bogey said, \"Just you wait till tomorrow.\"\n\nBut when morning came, and the children got up, the soldier was set on the window ledge. And whether the bogey did it, or there was a gust of wind, all of a sudden the window flew open and the soldier pitched out headlong from the third floor. He fell at breathtaking speed and landed cap first, with his bayonet buried between the paving stones and his one leg stuck straight in the air. The housemaid and the little boy ran down to look for him and, though they nearly stepped on the tin soldier, they walked right past without seeing him. If the soldier had called, \"Here I am!\" they would surely have found him, but he thought it contemptible to raise an uproar while he was wearing his uniform.\n\nSoon it began to rain. The drops fell faster and faster, until they came down by the bucketful. As soon as the rain let up, along came two young rapscallions.\n\n\"Hi, look!\" one of them said, \"there's a tin soldier. Let's send him sailing.\"\n\nThey made a boat out of newspaper, put the tin soldier in the middle of it, and away he went down the gutter with the two young rapscallions running beside him and clapping their hands. High heavens! How the waves splashed, and how fast the water ran down the gutter. Don't forget that it had just been raining by the bucketful. The paper boat pitched, and tossed, and sometimes it whirled about so rapidly that it made the soldier's head spin. But he stood as steady as ever. Never once flinching, he kept his eyes front, and carried his gun shoulder-high. Suddenly the boat rushed under a long plank where the gutter was boarded over. It was as dark as the soldier's own box.\n\n\"Where can I be going?\" the soldier wondered. \"This must be that black bogey's revenge. Ah! if only I had the little lady with me, it could be twice as dark here for all that I would care.\"\n\nOut popped a great water rat who lived under the gutter plank.\n\n\"Have you a passport?\" said the rat. \"Hand it over.\"\n\nThe soldier kept quiet and held his musket tighter. On rushed the boat, and the rat came right after it, gnashing his teeth as he called to the sticks and straws:\n\n\"Halt him! Stop him! He didn't pay his toll. He hasn't shown his passport. \"But the current ran stronger and stronger. The soldier could see daylight ahead where the board ended, but he also heard a roar that would frighten the bravest of us. Hold on! Right at the end of that gutter plank the water poured into the great canal. It was as dangerous to him as a waterfall would be to us.\n\nHe was so near it he could not possibly stop. The boat plunged into the whirlpool. The poor tin soldier stood as staunch as he could, and no one can say that he so much as blinked an eye. Thrice and again the boat spun around. It filled to the top - and was bound to sink. The water was up to his neck and still the boat went down, deeper, deeper, deeper, and the paper got soft and limp. Then the water rushed over his head. He thought of the pretty little dancer whom he'd never see again, and in his ears rang an old, old song:\n\n\"Farewell, farewell, O warrior brave,\n\nNobody can from Death thee save.\"\n\nAnd now the paper boat broke beneath him, and the soldier sank right through. And just at that moment he was swallowed by a most enormous fish.\n\nMy! how dark it was inside that fish. It was darker than under the gutter-plank and it was so cramped, but the tin soldier still was staunch. He lay there full length, soldier fashion, with musket to shoulder.\n\nThen the fish flopped and floundered in a most unaccountable way. Finally it was perfectly still, and after a while something struck through him like a flash of lightning. The tin soldier saw daylight again, and he heard a voice say, \"The Tin Soldier!\" The fish had been caught, carried to market, bought, and brought to a kitchen where the cook cut him open with her big knife.\n\nShe picked the soldier up bodily between her two fingers, and carried him off upstairs. Everyone wanted to see this remarkable traveler who had traveled about in a fish's stomach, but the tin soldier took no pride in it. They put him on the table and-lo and behold, what curious things can happen in this world-there he was, back in the same room as before. He saw the same children, the same toys were on the table, and there was the same fine castle with the pretty little dancer. She still balanced on one leg, with the other raised high. She too was steadfast. That touched the soldier so deeply that he would have cried tin tears, only soldiers never cry. He looked at her, and she looked at him, and never a word was said. Just as things were going so nicely for them, one of the little boys snatched up the tin soldier and threw him into the stove. He did it for no reason at all. That black bogey in the snuffbox must have put him up to it.\n\nThe tin soldier stood there dressed in flames. He felt a terrible heat, but whether it came from the flames or from his love he didn't know. He'd lost his splendid colors, maybe from his hard journey, maybe from grief, nobody can say.\n\nHe looked at the little lady, and she looked at him, and he felt himself melting. But still he stood steadfast, with his musket held trim on his shoulder.\n\nThen the door blew open. A puff of wind struck the dancer. She flew like a sylph, straight into the fire with the soldier, blazed up in a flash, and was gone. The tin soldier melted, all in a lump. The next day, when a servant took up the ashes she found him in the shape of a little tin heart. But of the pretty dancer nothing was left except her spangle, and it was burned as black as a coal."

Nhà vua muốn kén cho nàng một người chồng thật xứng đáng.\n\nMột hôm có hai chàng trai đến, xin ra mắt nhà vua để cầu hôn. Một người ở vùng núi Ba Vì, tuấn tú và tài giỏi khác thường: chỉ tay về phía đông, phía đông biến thành đồng lúa xanh, chỉ tay về phía tây, phía tây mọc lên hàng dãy núi. Nhân dân trong vùng gọi chàng là Sơn Tinh. Còn một người ở mãi tận miền biển Đông tài giỏi cũng không kém: gọi gió, gió đến, hò ma, ma tới – Chàng này tên gọi là Thủy Tinh.\n\nMột người là chúa của miền non cao, một người là chúa của vùng nước thẳm, cả hai đều xứng đáng làm rể vua Hùng cả. Hùng Vương băn khoăn không biết nhận lời ai, từ chối ai. Nhà vua cho mời các quan lạc hầu vào bàn mà vẫn không tìm được kế hay. Cuối cùng, Hùng Vương phán rằng:\n\n– Hai người đều vừa ý ta cả, nhưng ta chỉ có một người con gái, biết gả cho người nào? Ngày mai, nếu ai đem đồ sính lễ đến đây trước: một trăm ván cơm nếp, hai trăm nệp bánh chưng, voi chín ngà, gà chín cựa, ngựa chín hồng mao, thì được rước dâu về.\n\nSáng sớm hôm sau, Sơn Tinh đã đem đầy đủ lễ vật đến trước và được phép đưa dâu về núi. Thủy Tinh đến sau, không lấy được vợ, đùng đùng nổi giận, đem quân đuổi theo, một hai đòi cướp lại Mỵ Nương.\nThủy Tinh hô ma, gọi gió, làm thành dông bão đùng đùng rung chuyển cả đất trời, dâng nước sông lên cuồn cuộn tiến đánh Sơn Tinh. Nước ngập lúa, ngập đồng rồi ngập nhà, ngập cửa.\n\nSơn Tinh không hề nao núng, dùng phép màu bốc từng quả đồi, di từng dãy núi chặn đứng dòng nước lũ. Nước dâng lên cao bao nhiêu, Sơn Tinh lại làm cho đồi, núi mọc cao lên bấy nhiêu. Hai bên đánh nhau ròng rã mấy tháng trời liền, cuối cùng Thủy Tinh đuối sức phải rút quân về.\n\nTừ đó, oán ngày càng thêm nặng, thù ngày càng thêm sâu, không năm nào Thủy Tinh không làm mưa làm bão, dâng nước lên đánh Sơn Tinh và lần nào Thủy Tinh cũng thua, phải bỏ chạy."
